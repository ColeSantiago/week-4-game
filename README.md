# Crystal Game

Built with HTML5, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery.

The user is given a random number at the start of the game. There are four gems and by clicking on one they will add a specific amount of points to their total score. The game is won when the total score matched the random number, and lost if the total score goes above the random number. The value of each crystal is hidden until clicked. Each time the game starts, the random number and the value of the gems will change.
